### PROBLEM STATEMENT:
The problem statement is to prepare a concise report that outlines the differences between customers who accepted or declined coupons. Specifically, What factors influence a driver’s decision to accept a coupon once it’s delivered to their phones and the likelihood of a driver accepting a coupon. To analyze the data, I have aimed to plot and provide statistical summaries.

### DATA ANALYSIS FINDINGS:

For bar coupons I have done two separate batches. The first batch includes all drivers (not limited to bar coupons), and I study their coupon acceptance rate based on how often they frequent bars. The second batch studied drivers who exclusively were provided bar coupons. 

**BATCH 1 (all drivers not limited to bar coupons):**

1). The acceptance rate of those who went to a bar 3 or fewer times a month is approximately: 56.2%

2). The acceptance rate of those who went to a bar more than 3 times a month is approximately: 62.2%

3). Drivers who go to a bar more than once a month and are over the age of 25 have a 62.1% acceptance rate.

4). Drivers who go to bars more than once a month and had passengers that were not a kid and had occupations other than farming, fishing, or forestry had an acceptance rate of: 62.3%

5). The acceptance rate for people who go to bars more than once a month and are under the age of 30 is about 63%

The drivers who accepted the bar coupons the most were people who already frequented the bars many times a month. It is also apparent that people who went to the bar less than 3 times a month only accepted the coupon 56.2% of the time as opposed to the 62.2% acceptance rate of those who went to a bar more than 3 times a month. 

**BATCH 2 (exclusively bar coupons):**

1). The acceptance rate of those who went to a bar 3 or fewer times a month is approximately: 37%

2). The acceptance rate of those who went to a bar more than 3 times a month is approximately: 77%

3). Drivers who go to a bar more than once a month and are over the age of 25 have a 68.8% acceptance rate. This is a decrease from the drivers acceptance rate of those who went to a bar more than 3 times a month.

4). Acceptance rate is about 71% for drivers who go to bars more than once a month and had passengers that were not a kid and had occupations other than farming, fishing, or forestry.

5). The acceptance rate for people who go to bars more than once a month and are under the age of 30 is around 73%


### INDIVIDUAL STUDY
**I chose to Investigate the coffee house coupon (coupon exclusively being for coffee house). The findings are:**

1). The acceptance rate of those who went to a coffee house 3 or fewer times a month is approximately: 45%

2). The acceptance rate of those who went to a coffee house more than 3 times a month is approximately: 68%

3). Drivers who go to a coffee house more than once a month and are over the age of 30 have a 64.5% acceptance rate.

4). Drivers who go to a coffee house more than once a month and are under the age of 30 have about a 68% acceptance rate.

5). Students have an acceptance rate of 62.5%. Unemployed people have an acceptance rate of 54.2%. People under occpuation "Computer & Mathematical" have an acceptance rate of about 50%.

The acceptance rate increases for people who visit a coffee house more often. It is also evident that people under the age of 30 have an increased acceptance rate compared to people over 30. Also, out of the top 3 occupations, students have the highest acceptance rate of 62.5%. **Therefore, students under the age of 30, who also frequent coffee shops, are more prone to using provided coupons.**
